### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

### This is the repository of Ekaterina Butyugina 

I am a PhD in Computational Fluid Dynamics turned Data Scientist. 

Having a background in academia helps me to understand the data and apply both analytical and creative approaches.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on internal company projects.  
 
- I attended an intensive course on Data Science at [Constructor Learning](https://learning.constructor.org/), where I stayed on as a TA, then Consultant, and now as a Program Manager. I work with the following technologies (which we also pass on to our students):   

  - Python, Web Scraping, APIs   
  - Visualization (incl. Interactive) with Python, Plotly, Bokeh, Streamlit 
  - Machine Learning - scikit-learn, regression, anomaly detection, clustering, ensemble methods 
  - Deep Learning - Tensorflow, Keras, neural networks, CNNs, transfer learning, image segmentation, object detection
  - Natural Language Processing - text classification, summarization, clustering and similarity, machine translation, sentiment analysis, search and information retrieval, parsing and named entity recognition, classical NLP and transformers
  - ML Engineering - SQL, Docker, CI/CD, serving models, MLFlow
  - Explainable AI - SHAP, GradCam, Lime, etc
 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently interested in contributing to open source projects.  
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on interesting Data projects.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about how to start a career in Data Science.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ekaterina-butyugina/). 
- âš¡ Fun fact: as a student I organized gothic parties and I still like to participate in creative activities together with other people.
