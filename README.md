# Hi there

This is a GitHub account of Ekaterina Butyugina. 
I am a Computational Fluid Dynamics PhD currently working in Data Science. 

Having background in academia helps me to understand the data and apply both analytical and creative approaches. I love to implement challenging projects in a team as well as independently, try new techniques and provide ideas.
